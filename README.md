# ToA Particle Filter for Swarm Elements
A Rust-based implementation of a **Time of Arrival (ToA) Particle Filter** for swarm localization.

This project demonstrates how to use a particle filter to estimate the position of swarm elements based on noisy time-of-arrival (ToA) measurements from anchor points and coherence measurements between swarm elements.
